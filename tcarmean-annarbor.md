# Ann Arbor, Michigan

### Great places to eat
[Grange Kitchen & Bar](http://www.grangekitchenandbar.com/) is a great place. All ingredients are sourced within 100 miles of Ann Arbor, Michigan.

[Tomukun](http://www.tomukun.com/) is a pretty tasty Korean BBQ and Noodle Bar.

[Slurping Turtle](http://slurpingturtle.com/annarbor/) is a (fairly) authentic Ramen shop.

### Fun things to do
The [Ann Arbor Farmer's Market](http://www.a2gov.org/departments/Parks-Recreation/parks-places/farmers-market/Pages/default.aspx) is the longest running, year round, farmer's market in the country.
